When dancing, it’s hard to find her without the biggest smile across her face, and she wants that to happen for you too! When off the dance floor, you might find her breaking glass with operatic high notes or cultivating more amazing musicians. Erin is always down for a music jam and willing to volunteer some jazz vocals- her happy place is where dancing and live music meet.",

She has been known to groove out on dance floors indiscriminately, only occasionally mistaking a hallway or store line for one. Dance-shame is not something she has; excitement to see YOU on the floor is :D",

She is the one to ask for all the Jazzy goings-on at Jazz Attack and with Lindy Hop in the greater Philadelphia area. She is always down to dance to ‘Banana Split For My Baby’ by Louis Prima and to have a conversation about the true history of Jazz, Dance, Fashion, and American breakfast cereals.",
